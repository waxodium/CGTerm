<h1 align="center"> CGTerm </h1> 

**CGTerm** is a minimal terminal-like interface written in Go & C. It provides a simple interactive command loop with a small set of built-in commands for system interaction and basic screen control.

The project is intentionally lightweight and serves as a foundation for experimenting with terminal behavior, command handling, and modular Go packages.

## Features
* **Interactive prompt:** Simple `-->` interface.
* **Built-in commands:** common commands to help.
* **Modular package structure:** Own commands can be easily added. To do this read [How to make custom commands](./docs.md) 
* **Basic terminal control:** Functions for clearing the screen and listing directories.

## Requirements
- [Golang](https://go.dev/dl/)
- 5mb+ storage

## Building & Installing

### Builds
Building can be done with ``make`` or building directly with ``go``

1. clone CGTerm repository
```
git clone https://github.com/MasterArd/CGTerm.git
cd CGTerm
```

2. Build using make
```
make build
```
or **with GO**
```
go build .
```
### Install

Installation: Manually move the built binary named ``CGTerm`` to the bin directory.
```
sudo mv CGTerm /usr/bin
```

[Sheh] works including any other commands. If CGTerm is installed.

### Run CGTerm
Once installed to the bin directory. Launch ``CGTerm``. 


> **Binaries can be found at [Releases](https://github.com/MasterArd/CGTerm/releases/)**
