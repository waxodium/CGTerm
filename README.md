# CGTerm

**CGTerm** is a minimal terminal-like interface written in Go & C. It provides a simple interactive command loop with a small set of built-in commands for system interaction and basic screen control.

The project is intentionally lightweight and serves as a foundation for experimenting with terminal behavior, command handling, and modular Go packages.

## Features
* **Interactive prompt:** Simple `-->` interface.
* **Built-in commands:** common commands to help.
* **Modular package structure:** Own commands can be easily added. To do this read [How to make custom commands](./custom-commands.md) 
* **Basic terminal control:** Functions for clearing the screen and listing directories.

## Requirements
- [Golang](https://go.dev/dl/)
- 5mb+ storage
