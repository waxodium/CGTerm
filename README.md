# CGTerm

**CGTerm** is a minimal terminal-like interface written in Go. It provides a simple interactive command loop with a small set of built-in commands for system interaction and basic screen control.

The project is intentionally lightweight and serves as a foundation for experimenting with terminal behavior, command handling, and modular Go packages.

## Features
* **Interactive prompt:** Simple `-->` interface.
* **Built-in command handling:** Standardized command processing.
* **Modular package structure:** commands separated into the `gpkg` directory.
* **Basic terminal control:** Functions for clearing the screen and resetting the cursor.
* **Settings handling:** Basic file creation and management.

## Requirements
- Go install via:https://go.dev/dl/
- 1mb storage
